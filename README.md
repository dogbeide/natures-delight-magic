# natures-delight-magic

An e-commerce site for art, food, and esoteric services

### So far what works is:
  * Homepage, Navigation bar
  * Signup, Sign-in, Sign-out --> Firebase auth
  * GALLERY page
    * Clothing 
    * Add to Cart button
  - Cart
    - displays item count on icon
    - displays items in dropdown list
    - GO TO CHECKOUT button
  - Checkout page
    - display items, count, price, and total
    - increment count, delete items, remove all of same type

### Bugs:
- Google sign in - works on dev, doesn't on production.

### Tools:
- Built in React with Vite, 
- react-router, 
- context, 
- stateful functional components, 
- firebase auth user account storage, 
- Shop data from demo .json
